      <p>I've got a couple main hobbies, most include a lot of hands on work. It's best desicribed I enjoy anything fast, loud, or dangerous. Anything mechanical peaks my interest and I seem to catch onto quickly. First hobby is working on cars, at 19 my current truck is the 6th vehicle I've owned(and by far the most reliable). I like working with cattle and horses, and will be starting bull riding(along with working back on the ranch) as soon as I finish the spring semester here at UND. Another one of my main hobbies is hunting, I've done it since I could walk and it gives me an excuse to go and visit grandparents. I live for being outdoors, from working to camping to getting lost/stuck in the middle of the Montana wilderness. </p>
