    <p>My major is Commercial Aviation: Rotary Wing. I don't have as many classes this semester as I did last but that's alright. I'm taking AVIT 241 (Groundschool for Helicopters), English 110 which I despise, CSCI 110 which now that I'm starting to figure it out it's becoming somewhat fun, and Intro to Metalsmithing. My major can be very challenging at times but it's probably the coolest job that I could think of. I really did not want to go to college, instead I'd rather be a cowboy. But mom didn't approve so now thats just a summer gig. The hardest part about my major isnt the academics, flying, or even having school 6 days a week. The hardest part about flying helcioters is, the cost. Did you know its about $600/hr to fly a helicopter here at UND? At 2.5-3 hours a week it adds up very very quickly. </p>
