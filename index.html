      <p>My name is Cash Clendenen, I just turned 19. I'm orignally from Spearfish, South Dakota in the Black Hills. But since covid started I moved up to near Bowman, ND so I could work on a ranch. I've never been very into computers or "coding" but I'd heard you were a good professor and your classes weren't too difficult so here I am, struggling beyond belief to figure this out. I'm hoping that once I get the basics down I'll actually have some fun in this class. One thing I've found so far is that the discord that is set up for student help is by far the best possible help I could've gotten on this assignment.</p>
